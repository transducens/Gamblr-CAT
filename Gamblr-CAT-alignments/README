INTRODUCTION
This tool is designed to perform the experiments reported in the paper
"Using word alignments to assist computer-aided translation
users by marking which target-side words to change or keep unedited",
submitted to the ACL-HTL'11 short papers.

It tests a new method to improve computer-aided translation systems
based on translation memory (TM) by using pre-computed word alignments
between the source and target segments in the translation units
(TUs) of the user's TM. When a new segment is to be translated by
the CAT user, our approach uses the word alignments in the matching
TUs to mark the words that should be changed or kept unedited to
transform the proposed translation into an adequate translation.

BUILDING THE APPLICATION
This package includes a build.xml file which is read by the tool "ant"
which automatically build the GizaWKRecommen.jar package and the javadoc
documentation. Both elements are placed at the directory "dist" by executing
the command.
